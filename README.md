# Machine Learning in EDA  
This repository contains a brief description of the main areas of machine learning and neural networks applications for Electronic Design Automation(EDA).  
Nowdays ML for EDA is rapidly gaining popularity in the field of chip design. The three main categories of ML algorithms for design purposes are presented below.

  * Supervised Design Metrics Prediction
  * Unsupervised Placement Optimization
  * Reinforcement Learning Placement Optimization
